Question Answers:

1. How long, on average, will it take the reactor to meltdown assuming it starts from room temperature (25C) and the rod lengths are 0?

Currently, it appears that the reactor will not melt down. I ran it a few times to 1 million ticks and it was still going.

2. How fast can the reactor be brought up to an operating temperature of 600C without having it subsequently meltdown?

On average, it takes somewhere between 164-195 ticks for the reactor to reach 600 Degrees, if it starts at 25 degrees and 0 cm rod insertion.

3. Starting with control rods inserted 50 cm, what's the highest temperature you can start at without the reactor melting down?

The maximum temperature with 50cm rod insertion is about 450 degrees using this controller.
